      <p>
        I’m Sara, a front-end developer with experience in Vue and Nuxt,
        currently expanding my skill set with React and Next.js. I enjoy
        building clean, responsive interfaces and working with modern frontend
        tools that prioritize performance and user experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me watching fantasy or sci-fi
        series, listening to music, painting, exploring fashion, or staying
        active. I believe creativity outside of tech makes me a better developer
        inside it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m always excited to collaborate, learn, and build products that feel
        thoughtful and usable.
